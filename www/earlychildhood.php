					Sutherland Shire Early Childhood Music
				</h1>
				<p>
					The Sutherland Shire Early Childhood Music program is based on the Kodaly approach to early childhood music education. To the casual observer, it might look like we are just playing and having fun. While the lessons are playful, every aspect of the curriculum is built upon a solid musical and developmental foundation. The programme caters for children aged 3 to 6 yrs. Weekly 45 min lessons are held during school terms.
				</p>
				<h2>
					What Happens at a Class?
				</h2>
				<p>
					The children grow in confidence as they are gently encouraged to find their own special voice: their very first musical instrument. Students experience the joys of exploring their voices and eventually succeed in pitch matching and expressing themselves creatively through song.
				</p>
				<p>
					The children enjoy musical activities such as singing stories, parachute games and playing musical instruments. While playing, moving and singing, children are improving their rhythmic competency, developing a sense of steady beat, becoming acquainted with tone colour, learning a repertoire of songs, experiencing different instruments, increasing their ability to listen, and of course, gaining a love of music that will last throughout their lives.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Benefits of Music
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our music program encourages socialisation, sharing, and participation in group activities. Early exposure to music can be an important influence on a child’s development. Research proves that music improves the ability of children to think, reason, create, and express. Music activities can boost memory, motivation, concentration, coordination, self-discipline and enhancing creativity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The warm, friendly atmosphere draws the children in which helps the children to become comfortable in the music lesson environment. Arriving a little before class provides time for your child to settle in to the musical environment allowing the lesson to start on time. The children are at an age where they are learning to be self-sufficient in a group setting of peers. Caregivers are encouraged to participate in the last 10 minutes of each lesson.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Free Trial Lesson for Prospective Students
				</h2>
				<p>
					New students are invited to attend a free trial lesson. The session is fun and gives the child a real taste of the activities that we offer and an indication of what weekly lessons are like.
				</p>
				<p>
					The free trial lesson is informative for parents who are invited to watch.
